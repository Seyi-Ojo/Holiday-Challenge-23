# Holiday-Challenge-23
For my submission
Hello, I created a VPC for my Bastion host and two private instances
Then, I created my files inside the Bastion Host including; default, myansiblepbk.yaml, inventory, index.php, ansible.cfg.
Thses files were used to deploy my NGINX web server and my application was published on the NGINX server
I set up my load balancer and attached a custom domain name....www.seyi-altschool.com
I set up myy auto-scaling too as instructed that it is not compulsory but for our knowledge's sake. 
I had to delete my auto-scaling at a later time because it created more instances and I could not risk being charged for the instances.
I did due diligence on this project and made my own research to set everything up, I learned a lot of new things in the processs.
Thank you for reading!
